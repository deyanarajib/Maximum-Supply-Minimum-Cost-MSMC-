Maximum Supply Minimum Cost Algorithm
Step-1:	Select row that having maximum supply (i).
Step-2: Select column that have minimum cost on row i (j).
Step-3: Let value = cij.
	a. Subtract this value from supply si and demand dj.
	b. If the supply si is 0, then cross (strike) that row and If the demand dj is 0 then cross (strike) that column.
Step-3:	Repeact this steps for all uncrossed (unstriked) rows and columns until all supply and demand values are 0.
